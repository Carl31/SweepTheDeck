## General info
This project, Sweep The Deck, is the deliverable product for our Software Development Practice team, 2022. 

## Technologies
We built Sweep The Deck with:
* [Unity](https://unity.com/) for the game engine. The code was written in C#. 
* Music developed with [Ableton](https://www.ableton.com/en/). 
* Pixel art created with [Asperite](https://www.aseprite.org/).

## Story line
You are known among the seven seas for being the most fearsome pirate ever known to mankind.
Known for sailing solo and defeating pirate groups by himself, he now sails towards the final quest of his
journey. The legendary island of Peak Whiskey. There lies a treasure of vast riches, unknown to
mankind. But to get there, he must face a vast army of monsters and skeletons, nothing like the low
level peasants he had ever faced before. Can he stand his ground, and sweep the decks full of
terrifyingly strong enemies? Only you can decide his fate.
